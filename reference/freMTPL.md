# French Motor Third-Part Liability datasets

In the two datasets `freMTPLfreq`, `freMTPLsev`, risk features are
collected for 413,169 motor third-part liability policies (observed
mostly on one year). In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as
well as the corresponding claim amounts. `freMTPLfreq` contains the risk
features and the claim number while `freMTPLsev` contains the claim
amount and the corresponding policy ID. Some claim amounts of
`freMTPLsev` are fixed claim amounts based on the French IRSA-IDA claim
convention, see, e.g., [`freIRSA`](freIRSA.md) and
<https://www.index-assurance.fr/pratique/sinistre/convention-irsa>.

In the two datasets `freMTPL2freq`, `freMTPL2sev`, risk features are
collected for 677,991 motor third-part liability policies (observed
mostly on one year). The period is approximately 2011-2013. In addition,
we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding claim
amounts. `freMTPL2freq` contains the risk features and the claim number
while `freMTPL2sev` contains the claim amount and the corresponding
policy ID. Some claim amounts of `freMTPL2sev` are fixed claim amounts
based on the French IRSA-IDA claim convention, see, e.g.,
[`freIRSA`](freIRSA.md) and
<https://www.index-assurance.fr/pratique/sinistre/convention-irsa>.

## Format

`freMTPLfreq` contains 10 columns:

- `PolicyID`:

  The policy ID (used to link with the claims dataset).

- `ClaimNb`:

  Number of claims during the exposure period.

- `Exposure`:

  The period of exposure for a policy, in years.

- `Power`:

  The power of the car (ordered categorical).

- `CarAge`:

  The vehicle age, in years.

- `DriverAge`:

  The driver age, in years (in France, people can drive a car at 18).

- `Brand`:

  The car brand divided in the following groups: `A`- Renaut Nissan and
  Citroen, `B`- Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda and Seat, `C`- Opel, General
  Motors and Ford, `D`- Fiat, `E`- Mercedes Chrysler and BMW, `F`-
  Japanese (except Nissan) and Korean, `G`- other.

- `Gas`:

  The car gas, Diesel or regular.

- `Region`:

  The policy region in France (based on the 1970-2015 classification).

- `Density`:

  The density of inhabitants (number of inhabitants per km2) in the city
  the driver of the car lives in.

`freMTPLsev` contains 2 columns:

- `PolicyID`:

  The occurence date (used to link with the contract dataset).

- `ClaimAmount`:

  The cost of the claim, seen as at a recent date.

`freMTPL2freq` contains 11 columns:

- `IDpol`:

  The policy ID (used to link with the claims dataset).

- `ClaimNb`:

  Number of claims during the exposure period.

- `Exposure`:

  The period of exposure for a policy, in years.

- `VehPower`:

  The power of the car (ordered values).

- `VehAge`:

  The vehicle age, in years.

- `DrivAge`:

  The driver age, in years (in France, people can drive a car at 18).

- `BonusMalus`:

  Bonus/malus, between 50 and 350: \<100 means bonus, \>100 means malus
  in France.

- `VehBrand`:

  The car brand (unknown categories).

- `VehGas`:

  The car gas, Diesel or regular.

- `Area`:

  The density value of the city community where the car driver lives in:
  from `"A"` for rural area to `"F"` for urban centre.

- `Density`:

  The density of inhabitants (number of inhabitants per
  square-kilometer) of the city where the car driver lives in.

- `Region`:

  The policy region in France (based on the 1970-2015 classification).

`freMTPL2sev` contains 2 columns:

- `IDpol`:

  The occurence date (used to link with the contract dataset).

- `ClaimAmount`:

  The cost of the claim, seen as at a recent date.
