\title{ French Motor Third-Part Liability datasets }

\description{
In the two datasets \code{freMTPLfreq},  \code{freMTPLsev}, risk features are collected
for 413,169 motor third-part liability policies (observed mostly on one year).
In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding
claim amounts.
\code{freMTPLfreq} contains the risk features and the claim number
while \code{freMTPLsev} contains the claim amount and the 
corresponding policy ID.
Some claim amounts of  \code{freMTPLsev} are fixed claim amounts
based on the French IRSA-IDA claim convention, see e.g.~\url{https://www.index-assurance.fr/pratique/sinistre/convention-irsa}.


In the two datasets \code{freMTPL2freq},  \code{freMTPL2sev}, risk features are collected
for 677,991 motor third-part liability policies (observed mostly on one year).
In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding
claim amounts.
\code{freMTPL2freq} contains the risk features and the claim number
while \code{freMTPL2sev} contains the claim amount and the
corresponding policy ID.
Some claim amounts of  \code{freMTPL2sev} are fixed claim amounts
based on the French IRSA-IDA claim convention, see e.g.~\url{https://www.index-assurance.fr/pratique/sinistre/convention-irsa}.

	\item{\code{Gas}}{The car gas, Diesel or regular.}
    \item{\code{Region}}{The policy region in France
    (based on the 1970-2015 classification).}
